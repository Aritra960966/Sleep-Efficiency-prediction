# Sleep Efficiency Prediction and Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting sleep efficiency using various regression models and performing comprehensive data analysis. The goal is to understand the effectiveness of different machine learning models in predicting sleep efficiency based on historical data. Additionally, clustering and visualization techniques are employed to gain deeper insights into the data.

## Models Implemented

- **Linear Regression**
- **Decision Tree Regressor**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **XGBoost Regressor**

## Performance Metrics

The performance of the models is evaluated using several metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), R² Score, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score. The metrics are computed for both training and testing datasets.

Here is a summary of the performance metrics for each model:

| Model                  | MAE (Train) | MAE (Test) | MSE (Train) | MSE (Test) | R² Score (Train) | R² Score (Test) | Accuracy (Train) | Accuracy (Test) | Precision (Train) | Precision (Test) | Recall (Train) | Recall (Test) | F1 Score (Train) | F1 Score (Test) |

## Clustering and Visualization

The dataset was also analyzed using clustering techniques and visualized to uncover patterns and insights. The visualizations help to understand the distribution of sleep efficiency and the relationships between different features.

## Getting Started

   git clone https://github.com/Aritra960966/sleep-efficiency-prediction.git


# Sleep Quality Analysis and Recommendations

## Conclusion

Analysis of sleep measurements and quality scores reveals an imbalance in the ratio of light to deep sleep for many individuals. Contrary to the ideal, where light sleep should constitute about half of total sleep, many people are spending a majority of their sleep in deep sleep stages. According to the Sleep Foundation's criteria, optimal sleep involves a balanced distribution between light and deep sleep phases.

## Recommendations

Despite generally adequate sleep duration and good sleep efficiency, the most significant area for improvement is increasing the proportion of light sleep relative to deep sleep and reducing the number of awakenings throughout the night. Additional factors that could enhance sleep quality include increasing physical exercise and reducing caffeine intake, particularly in the afternoon. To refine future analyses, it would be beneficial to clarify the definition of exercise frequency and include a time component for caffeine consumption.

## Tips for Better Sleep

For further improvement, consider the following recommendations from the CDC:

- **Get some exercise:** Engaging in physical activity during the day can help you fall asleep more easily at night.
- **Avoid large meals, caffeine, and alcohol before bedtime:** These can interfere with your ability to fall and stay asleep.
- **Be consistent:** Stick to a regular sleep schedule by going to bed and waking up at the same times each day, including weekends.
- **Create a restful environment:** Ensure your bedroom is quiet, dark, relaxing, and at a comfortable temperature.
- **Limit electronic devices:** Remove TVs, computers, and smartphones from the bedroom to minimize distractions.
