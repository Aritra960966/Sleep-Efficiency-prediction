# Sleep Quality Analysis and Recommendations

## Conclusion

Analysis of sleep measurements and quality scores reveals an imbalance in the ratio of light to deep sleep for many individuals. Contrary to the ideal, where light sleep should constitute about half of total sleep, many people are spending a majority of their sleep in deep sleep stages. According to the Sleep Foundation's criteria, optimal sleep involves a balanced distribution between light and deep sleep phases.

## Recommendations

Despite generally adequate sleep duration and good sleep efficiency, the most significant area for improvement is increasing the proportion of light sleep relative to deep sleep and reducing the number of awakenings throughout the night. Additional factors that could enhance sleep quality include increasing physical exercise and reducing caffeine intake, particularly in the afternoon. To refine future analyses, it would be beneficial to clarify the definition of exercise frequency and include a time component for caffeine consumption.

## Tips for Better Sleep

For further improvement, consider the following recommendations from the CDC:

- **Get some exercise:** Engaging in physical activity during the day can help you fall asleep more easily at night.
- **Avoid large meals, caffeine, and alcohol before bedtime:** These can interfere with your ability to fall and stay asleep.
- **Be consistent:** Stick to a regular sleep schedule by going to bed and waking up at the same times each day, including weekends.
- **Create a restful environment:** Ensure your bedroom is quiet, dark, relaxing, and at a comfortable temperature.
- **Limit electronic devices:** Remove TVs, computers, and smartphones from the bedroom to minimize distractions.
